# StatefulSets: deploying replicated stateful applications



Comparing StatefulSets with ReplicaSets

StatefulSet aren’t
exact replicas of each other. Each can have its own set of volumes—in other words,
storage (and thus persistent state)—which differentiates it from its peers. Pet pods
also have a predictable (and stable) identity instead of each new pod instance getting
a completely random one.

need to be addressable by their hostname,
govern-
ing Service belongs to the default namespace and is called foo, and one of the pods is called A-0, you can reach the pod through its fully qualified domain name, which
is a-0.foo.default.svc.cluster.local.

A StatefulSet replaces a lost pod with a new one with the same identity, whereas a
ReplicaSet replaces it with a completely new unrelated pod.

StatefulSets also never permit scale-down operations if any of
the instances are unhealthy


stable dedicated storage to each stateful instance
A StatefulSet creates both pods and PersistentVolumeClaims.

you’re required to
delete PersistentVolumeClaims manually to release the underlying PersistentVolume.


Using a StatefulSet

A simple stateful app: kubia-pet-image/app.js

persistent-volumes-hostpath.yaml
persistent-volumes-gcepd.yaml
kubia-service-headless.yaml
kubia-statefulset.yaml

volumeClaimTemplates

$ kubectl create -f kubia-statefulset.yaml
$ kubectl get po kubia-0 -o yaml

EXAMINING THE GENERATED PERSISTENTVOLUMECLAIMS
kubectl get pvc


COMMUNICATING WITH PODS THROUGH THE API SERVER
<apiServerHost>:<port>/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/kubia-0/proxy/<path>


kubia-service-public.yaml

10.4 Discovering peers in a StatefulSet
DNS SRV RECORDS

$ kubectl run -it srvlookup --image=tutum/dnsutils --rm
➥ --restart=Never -- dig SRV kubia.default.svc.cluster.local
kubia-pet-peers-image/app.js

spec.updateStrategy


$ kubectl delete po kubia-0 --force --grace-period 0
