# Automatic scaling of pods and cluster nodes
Kubernetes can monitor your pods and scale them up automatically as soon as it detects an increase in the CPU usage or some other metric.

15.1 Horizontal pod autoscaling

HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) resource
periodically checks pod metrics, calculates the number of replicas required to meet
the target metric value configured in the HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource

15.1.1 Understanding the autoscaling process

OBTAINING POD METRICS
gets the metrics of all the pods by querying Heapster
through REST calls.

A look at changes related to how the Autoscaler obtains metrics
1.6 != 1.7 != 1.9
--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-use-rest-clients=true flag
API server will not expose the metrics itself
